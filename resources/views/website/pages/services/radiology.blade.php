        Abdominal ultrasound (US) is an important diagnostic method for evaluation of
    many structures in the abdomen, such as the liver, gallbladder, biliary tract,
    pancreas and kidneys. Indications include abdominal, flank and/or back pain,
    palpable abnormalities, abnormal laboratory values suggestive for abdominal
    pathology, follow-up of known or suspected abnormalities and search for metastatic
    disease or occult primary.

        Ultrasound imaging of the pelvis uses sound waves to produce pictures of the
    structures and organs in the lower abdomen and pelvis. There are three types of
    pelvic ultrasound: abdominal, vaginal (for women), and rectal (for men). These
    exams are frequently used to evaluate the reproductive and urinary systems.
    Ultrasound is safe, noninvasive and does not use ionizing radiation.

        Obstetric ultrasound uses sound waves to produce pictures of a baby (embryo or
    fetus) within a pregnant woman, as well as the mother's uterus and ovaries. It does
    not use ionizing radiation, has no known harmful effects, and is the preferred
    method for monitoring pregnant women and their unborn babies.
    A Doppler ultrasound study – a technique that evaluates blood flow in the umbilical
    cord, fetus or placenta – may be part of this exam.

        <div class="textHeader"> Anomaly scan </div>

        Anomaly Scan or mid-pregnancy scan is an ultrasound scan done between the
    18th and 21st week of pregnancy to take a closer look at the baby and the womb
    (uterus) and to have an idea where the placenta is lying. The scan aims to look for
    any major physical abnormalities in the growing baby.
