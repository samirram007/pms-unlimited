        Haematology involves the diagnosis and treatment of patients who have disorders
    of the blood and bone marrow. Whilst a major part of a haematologist’s time is
    spent in providing direct clinical care to patients, diagnostic work in the laboratory
    is also a significant part of their work.

        <div class="textHeader"> Biochemistry </div>

        Biochemistry focuses on processes happening at a molecular level. It focuses on
    what’s happening inside our cells, studying components like proteins, lipids and
    organelles. It also looks at how cells communicate with each other, for example
    during growth or fighting illness. Biochemists need to understand how the structure
    of a molecule relates to its function, allowing them to predict how molecules
    will interact.

        Clinical pathology supports the diagnosis of disease using laboratory testing of
    blood and other bodily fluids, tissues, and microscopic evaluation of individual
    cells. Our board-certified veterinary clinical pathologists and technologists provide
    laboratory results in a timely, efficient and thoughtful manner; supporting research,
    clinicians, referring veterinarians, and students in the diagnosis and treatment of
    many animal species.
